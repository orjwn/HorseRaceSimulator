# HorseRaceSimulation

Written by: orjuwan

## Part 1

### Description
Each of the Horse and Race classes contains a separate main method designed for self-testing.

### Requirements
JDK or any IDE capable of running Java v22.

### Usage Instructions
Execute Main.java  to run tests for the horse class, which will display a series of outcomes for each test case.

The Race class relies on the TimeUnit, Math, and ArrayList libraries from java.util and java.lang. To test this class, execute its main method directly if no context variables are set. If context variables are present, utilize the startRace method on your Race object instead!
